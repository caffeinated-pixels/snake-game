# Nokia-style snake game

This simple, retro-styled snake game is based on the [Scrimba tutorial](https://scrimba.com/learn/snakegame) by Ania Kubrow. It's built entirely with vanilla JavaScript.

I've had a lot of fun adding my own styling and expanding the functionality, such as:

- persistent hiscore (using the web storage API)
- separate play & reset buttons
- pause function
- sound effects
- start, pause and gameover screens
- d-pad-style buttons for use on mobile devices
